# My Gnostic Revelation

This repository contains a personal philosophical position
inspired by Gnostic reflection and individual inquiry.

It represents a personal perspective, not a doctrine or system.

## What this is
- A personal interpretation of Gnostic thought
- A philosophical and metaphysical framework
- An individual position, open to revision and growth

## What this is NOT
- Not an organization, order, cult, or movement
- Not an initiatory system or hierarchy
- Not a belief system demanding adherence or loyalty

## Core perspective
- The material world is experienced as incomplete and mediated
- False authority arises when power replaces understanding
- Gnosis means knowledge, clarity, and awareness
- Liberation comes through insight, not obedience

## Ethical position
I reject any ideology, structure, or worldview that:
- Justifies violence as a path to truth
- Glorifies cruelty, domination, or dehumanization
- Treats human beings as tools, tests, or expendable material
- Enforces belief through fear, coercion, or psychological pressure

Knowledge does not require brutality.
Understanding does not emerge from imposed suffering.

## Respect for other traditions
While my position is gnostic in nature, I express respect for
other philosophical and spiritual perspectives, including:

- **Deism**, as a rational and non-authoritarian understanding
  of transcendence and cosmic order
- **Yazidism**, as an ancient spiritual tradition with its own
  internal integrity and depth

## Individual responsibility
Gnosis is personal.
It cannot be enforced, inherited, or institutionalized.

Any system that prioritizes power over understanding
inevitably becomes a distortion.

## Relation to technology
I value transparent systems over opaque ones.
Tools should increase clarity, not control.
Software should support understanding, not manipulation.

## 🌱 Ethical Statement: Care for Life and the Body-Spirit

### Veganism as a Spiritual Choice
I embrace veganism not merely as a diet, but as an ethical and spiritual commitment to respect **the lives of all sentient beings** and to abstain from participating in systems of exploitation, violence, and suffering. Veganism is not only about avoiding meat; it is a way of life that seeks to minimize involvement in practices that cause harm, as far as is possible and feasible. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism))

### Why This Matters
This aligns with the fundamental Gnostic principle of liberation from practices that increase suffering and distance one from inner clarity. Respect for life is respect for truth and consciousness, not mechanical consumption or domination. Such an attitude towards living beings helps maintain clarity of spirit and reduces participation in harm. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism))

## Substances and Self-Control
I approve the use of marijuana in moderation, respecting its ability to relax and expand consciousness. Alcohol is allowed only in moderation, as excess weakens the body and clouds the mind. Smoking and other harmful habits are rejected entirely, as they detract from clarity and inner development.

### Rejecting Smoking and Harmful Habits
I reject smoking and similar habits that damage the body and scatter the mind. These practices weaken the body, reduce the capacity for clear perception of reality, and act as a form of dependency that diverts attention from inner development. This aligns with the idea of self-mastery and liberation from mechanisms that weaken both spirit and body simultaneously.

They are grounded in individual responsibility,
respect for life, and rejection of violence,
coercion, and cult-like structures.
