# My Gnostic Revelation

This repository contains a personal philosophical position
inspired by Gnostic reflection and individual inquiry.

It represents a personal perspective, not a doctrine or system.

## What this is
- A personal interpretation of Gnostic thought
- A philosophical and metaphysical framework
- An individual position, open to revision and growth

## What this is NOT
- Not an organization, order, cult, or movement
- Not an initiatory system or hierarchy
- Not a belief system demanding adherence or loyalty

## Core perspective
- The material world is experienced as incomplete and mediated
- False authority arises when power replaces understanding
- Gnosis means knowledge, clarity, and awareness
- Liberation comes through insight, not obedience

## Ethical position
I reject any ideology, structure, or worldview that:
- Justifies violence as a path to truth
- Glorifies cruelty, domination, or dehumanization
- Treats human beings as tools, tests, or expendable material
- Enforces belief through fear, coercion, or psychological pressure

Knowledge does not require brutality.
Understanding does not emerge from imposed suffering.

## Respect for other traditions
While my position is gnostic in nature, I express respect for
other philosophical and spiritual perspectives, including:

- **Deism**, as a rational and non-authoritarian understanding
  of transcendence and cosmic order
- **Yazidism**, as an ancient spiritual tradition with its own
  internal integrity and depth
- **Spiritual Satanism**, when understood as an
  individual, non-violent, non-sectarian path focused on
  autonomy, ethics, and self-reflection, i dont support ONA, JoS, MLO, and other they are opponents of true Satanism

At the same time, I explicitly reject **sectarian or organizational
forms of Satanism** that revolve around cruelty, extremism,
violence, or the instrumentalization of human beings
(e.g. closed groups that function through shock, abuse,
or ideological control).

## Individual responsibility
Gnosis is personal.
It cannot be enforced, inherited, or institutionalized.

Any system that prioritizes power over understanding
inevitably becomes a distortion.

## Relation to technology
I value transparent systems over opaque ones.
Tools should increase clarity, not control.
Software should support understanding, not manipulation.

These notes reflect my current understanding.
They are grounded in individual responsibility,
respect for life, and rejection of violence,
coercion, and cult-like structures.
